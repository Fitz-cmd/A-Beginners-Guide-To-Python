#In Python the string 'l' is not the same as the string 'L'; 
one contains the lower-case letter 'l' and one the upper-case letter 'L'. 
If case sensitively does not matter to you 
then you should convert any strings 
you want to compare into a common case before doing any testing; 
for example 
using lower() as in
some_string.lower().startswith('h')
